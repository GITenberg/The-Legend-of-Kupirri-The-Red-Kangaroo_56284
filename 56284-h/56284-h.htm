<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Natives of a certain district of Port Lincoln, when questioned as to
the cause of the non-existence of that species of Kangaroo known to the
Colonists as the great <i>Red Kangaroo</i>, have the following legend in
reference to its extinction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“In former times, one of the species, inhabited Port Lincoln, his
name was <i>Kupirri</i>, he was of stupendous size, and devoured all
those who attempted to spear him. His very appearance inspired the
natives with overwhelming terror, so that they lost all presence of
mind, even flinging away their <i>midlahs</i>. At last, however, a match
was found for the monster Kangaroo, in two renowned hunters, Pilla
and Inda, who, falling upon its track near Port Lincoln, on the
range stretching to the North, followed and overtook it on Mount
Nilarro. Finding it asleep, they at once attacked it, but before
they could quite kill it, their spears became blunt; they then
quarrelled with each other, and Pilla stabbed his antagonist with
one of the blunt spears, in many places, while he himself received
a severe blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> over his nose. Becoming reconciled, the friends
again attacked and killed Kupirri and, on opening it, found, to
their utter astonishment, the dead bodies of their comrades
previously devoured by the monster. Being no less skilled in the
medical art than in hunting, they succeeded in reviving and healing
these unfortunate men. They all then betook themselves to roasting
and devouring Kupirri in return. The feast over, and their bodies
comfortably greased, they returned to their mourning families, who
received them with every demonstration of joy at the happy
termination of their adventures. The two heroes were afterwards
metamorphosed into, and gave origin to, two species of animals&mdash;the
<i>Oppossum</i>, and the <i>Native Cat</i>&mdash;retaining as such, not only their
names, but also the scars of the wounds that they inflicted on each
other&mdash;in the shape of a furrow down the former’s nose, and of a
number of white spots sprinkled over the skin of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> From a pamphlet by C. W. Schurmann, 1846.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;In the Breccia caves of the Portland district, and
elsewhere, huge bones of an extinct kangaroo have been found. It is
possible, therefore, that this legend has some foundation in fact,
which in the lapse of time has moulded itself in the present form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>&mdash;“I cannot sit down without making an allusion to a cognate
subject that for a very long time has occupied my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> attention. I
allude to the legends and traditions of the aborigines of
Australia. It is possible that the gentlemen present may doubt of
their existence, but I beg to assure them that the tribes of
Australia are not so barren in these particulars as may be
imagined. There is scarcely a constellation in the heavens that has
not its appropriate legend, and the animals of the land are
invested with the supernatural. Capes, promontories, and islands of
our shores are transformations, or are otherwise connected with
legendary lore. The origin of their own species, and their various
ceremonies, abound with singular and exotic ideas, and the wildest
fancies. The Australian savage has his myths, legends, and poetry,
like his brothers of other regions; and I mention it for the
purpose of throwing out a suggestion to the members of the
Philosophical Society, that it would be an interesting work, and
worthy of the employment of some portion of their funds to collect
and collate together these treasures, before the race disappears
from off the face of the land. Sir George Grey has done as much for
New Zealand, and I sincerely hope that ere long the same may be
accomplished for Australia.”</p></div>

<h2><a name="NOTES_c" id="NOTES_c"></a>NOTES, &amp;c.</h2>

<div class="nnts">
<p>“Artful, deep manœuvring.”&mdash;The natives have various methods to
capture their prey, all indicitive of true huntsmen’s craft. Sneaking
the emu, a wary bird, is an instance where, With a screen of boughs
before him, the native gradually creeps within spear-range, and soon
gains his prize.</p>

<p>“Ancient Curses.”&mdash;Such curses are used when hunting. The different
kinds of game have different curses.</p>

<p>“Abandoned all.”&mdash;When a native throws away his spears, it is a sign of
the greatest fear and distress.</p>

<p>“Boston Bay.”&mdash;The harbour of Port Lincoln. It is protected by Boston
Island.</p>

<p>“Bultawilta.”&mdash;A man’s name.</p>

<p>“Burka.”&mdash;An aged man, the last stage through which men pass, and with
whom the knowledge of all charms, ceremonies, &amp;c., is deposited.</p>

<p>“Bodies greased.”&mdash;A luxury highly appreciated by the natives. Captain
Sturt and Sir T. Mitchell bear testimony, that to a naked savage, in a
hot climate, it is, and must be, a great luxury. It supples the skin,
and prevents it chapping. The fat of all game is used for this purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boys in front.”&mdash;Descriptive of the order in which, on all public
occasions, the natives arrange themselves; the children are invariably
placed in front.</p>

<p>“Cape Catastrophe.”&mdash;The South point of Port Lincoln district. Here
Captain Flinders had the misfortune to lose a boat’s crew, hence its
ominous name.</p>

<p>“Cooey.”&mdash;A loud call.</p>

<p>“Cut their arms.”&mdash;To this may be added, singing the hair off the head
with live coals, putting a large mass of white clay on the head, and
smearing the body over with the same, as signs of mourning for the dead.</p>

<p>“Corrobbories.”&mdash;Simply a play, and the highest, both in scope and
character of all their amusements. It is generally performed at night,
but occasionally in the day. The words sung are frequently meaningless,
or handed down from so remote a period as to have lost all meaning. The
corrobbory in the text is literally translated. Any incident, comic or
grave, trivial or important, may form the words of a corrobbory. The
song rarely exceeds two lines.</p>

<p>“Cowee.”&mdash;Water&mdash;the sea.</p>

<p>“Gunya.”&mdash;Hut&mdash;the same as wurley.</p>

<p>“Heaven’s bridegroom.”&mdash;In the native mythology, the sun is a woman, and
the moon a man. The former beats the latter till he dies; but dying, he
revives, and this goes on for ever hence the phases of the moon.</p>

<p>“Kyahs.”&mdash;Implements of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kokunya.”&mdash;The curlew, said at times to be inhabited with the spirit of
death. If a native dreams of his visitation, he dies.</p>

<p>“Kuttas.”&mdash;Implements for digging.</p>

<p>“Kupe.”&mdash;A grub inhabiting gum-trees, grass-sticks, &amp;c. Though the
softest of creatures, it penetrates the hardest of woods. Its natural
history is little known. When <i>once</i> eaten by Europeans it is so
relished as never after to be despised. The difficulty lies in the
<i>first</i> attempt.</p>

<p>“Kuinyo.”&mdash;A fabulous being&mdash;death.</p>

<p>“Kupirri.”&mdash;The proper name for the red kangaroo.</p>

<p>“Lubras.”&mdash;It is singular, that whilst the language is replete with
terms of relationship, there should be found no distinction in the terms
for husband and wife. The word <i>lubra</i> is used indifferently for either.</p>

<p>“Paityowattas.”&mdash;Small instruments used in incantations.</p>

<p>Page 7. “Behold them on the open plain,” &amp;c.&mdash;Illustrative of children’s
games, to which may be added the ball, and what is known to Europeans as
the scratch-cradle.</p>

<p>Page 15. “Cowering nearer,” &amp;c.&mdash;The current belief of the tribe.</p>

estimation, a man or a tribe’s welfare consists.</p>

dress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Page 21. “Repeat their charms,” &amp;c.&mdash;No native retires to rest without
some such precaution; their belief is, that evil spirits are busy, in
the darkness, to kill them. Fire is a sure guardian. The writer once met
a native, many miles from his camp, benighted; he carried a large
fire-stick for protection.</p>

<p>“Paune.”&mdash;The name given to the ninth child. Sorcerers can change
themselves into any shape or substance, instantaneously. Each tribe
regards the other as peculiar adepts in sorcery. This belief in
witchcraft exercises a most baneful influence on the native mind. It is
the source of nearly all their quarrels and violent deaths.</p>

<p>“Patta tree.”&mdash;A kind of gum tree.</p>

<p>“Manurapindoo.”&mdash;A mystic curse, used in hunting.</p>

<p>“North.”&mdash;The North is regarded by the natives as the great seat of
diabolical agency, witchcraft, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Ngamma.”&mdash;A man’s name.</p>

<p>“Nillaro.”&mdash;A mountain in the Port Lincoln district.</p>

<p>“O why did you die,” &amp;c.&mdash;A literal translation of a lament for the
dead.</p>

<p>“Spearing fish.”&mdash;On the Onkaparinga, the Murray, the Lake, &amp;c., fish
are speared. All the spears are jagged, and vary in length according to
the fish to be taken, from six feet to twelve or fourteen feet; the
latter are for the Murray cod.</p>

<p>“Strike him,” &amp;c.&mdash;Literal translations of the curses used on such
occasions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Strike their shields.”&mdash;Mode of salutation in war, as well as in peace,
and before a battle very striking and picturesque.</p>

<p>“Spirits bad.”&mdash;The aborigines have no <i>good</i> spirits.</p>

<p>“Sacred leg.”&mdash;Women and children are not allowed to eat the hind leg of
a kangaroo&mdash;it is sacred.</p>

<p>“Tau.”&mdash;A woman’s name.</p>

<p>“Tunte nung.”&mdash;Mid-day.</p>

<p>“Tears run down.”&mdash;The expression of sorrow, by the native man, is
intense; tears will stream down the face, whilst the most sorrowful
lamentations pierce the air, at the same time the women cut themselves,
and the men spear each other in the arm; this occurs particularly at
funeral solemnities.</p>

<p>“Wurleys.”&mdash;Native huts, made from the boughs of trees, and in winter
strongly constructed, of a dome shape, and capable of holding from six
to a dozen persons. Near whaling stations, the ribs of whales are
employed as the frame-work, and the divisions filled up with boughs and
sea-weed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
