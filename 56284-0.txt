PREFACE.


The Natives of a certain district of Port Lincoln, when questioned as to
the cause of the non-existence of that species of Kangaroo known to the
Colonists as the great _Red Kangaroo_, have the following legend in
reference to its extinction:--

     “In former times, one of the species, inhabited Port Lincoln, his
     name was _Kupirri_, he was of stupendous size, and devoured all
     those who attempted to spear him. His very appearance inspired the
     natives with overwhelming terror, so that they lost all presence of
     mind, even flinging away their _midlahs_. At last, however, a match
     was found for the monster Kangaroo, in two renowned hunters, Pilla
     and Inda, who, falling upon its track near Port Lincoln, on the
     range stretching to the North, followed and overtook it on Mount
     Nilarro. Finding it asleep, they at once attacked it, but before
     they could quite kill it, their spears became blunt; they then
     quarrelled with each other, and Pilla stabbed his antagonist with
     one of the blunt spears, in many places, while he himself received
     a severe blow over his nose. Becoming reconciled, the friends
     again attacked and killed Kupirri and, on opening it, found, to
     their utter astonishment, the dead bodies of their comrades
     previously devoured by the monster. Being no less skilled in the
     medical art than in hunting, they succeeded in reviving and healing
     these unfortunate men. They all then betook themselves to roasting
     and devouring Kupirri in return. The feast over, and their bodies
     comfortably greased, they returned to their mourning families, who
     received them with every demonstration of joy at the happy
     termination of their adventures. The two heroes were afterwards
     metamorphosed into, and gave origin to, two species of animals--the
     _Oppossum_, and the _Native Cat_--retaining as such, not only their
     names, but also the scars of the wounds that they inflicted on each
     other--in the shape of a furrow down the former’s nose, and of a
     number of white spots sprinkled over the skin of the latter.[A]

     NOTE 1.--In the Breccia caves of the Portland district, and
     elsewhere, huge bones of an extinct kangaroo have been found. It is
     possible, therefore, that this legend has some foundation in fact,
     which in the lapse of time has moulded itself in the present form.

     NOTE 2.--“I cannot sit down without making an allusion to a cognate
     subject that for a very long time has occupied my attention. I
     allude to the legends and traditions of the aborigines of
     Australia. It is possible that the gentlemen present may doubt of
     their existence, but I beg to assure them that the tribes of
     Australia are not so barren in these particulars as may be
     imagined. There is scarcely a constellation in the heavens that has
     not its appropriate legend, and the animals of the land are
     invested with the supernatural. Capes, promontories, and islands of
     our shores are transformations, or are otherwise connected with
     legendary lore. The origin of their own species, and their various
     ceremonies, abound with singular and exotic ideas, and the wildest
     fancies. The Australian savage has his myths, legends, and poetry,
     like his brothers of other regions; and I mention it for the
     purpose of throwing out a suggestion to the members of the
     Philosophical Society, that it would be an interesting work, and
     worthy of the employment of some portion of their funds to collect
     and collate together these treasures, before the race disappears
     from off the face of the land. Sir George Grey has done as much for
     New Zealand, and I sincerely hope that ere long the same may be
     accomplished for Australia.”

THE LEGEND

OF

THE RED KANGAROO.


    The rippling waves of Boston Bay
    Lay glimm’ring in the fading day
    Growing shadows were length’ning o’er,
    Dark’ning the distant islet’s shore.

    Far away in the open sea,
    Beyond the Cape Catastrophe,
    The sun shot forth its golden ray,
    And kiss’d each wave in parting play.

    Gorg’ous colours o’erspread the sky,
    From farthest verge that’s scann’d by eye,
    To where the sun’s effulgent rays
    Pour’d forth its last resplendent blaze.

    Majestic clouds were pil’d and mass’d,
    In form sublime and grand in rest,
    In true perspective--line on line,
    Till mix’d and lost in hues divine.

    Splashing loud on the pebbly beach,
    The dimpling waves were chasing each
    Filling inlet, dent, and bay,
    With murmurs soft, and sparkling spray.

    The scrub wav’d gently to and fro,
    A green irradiating bow;
    The she-oak in the distant view,
    Whisper’d a mournful, sad adieu.

    The bold hills in a rounding line,
    Glorious in a sunny clime,
    Purpling when the bright eve declines,
    Dark’ning as day its rule resigns.

    The tribe was camp’d beside a hill,
    Near a transparent gurgling rill;
    On a bold bluff the _wurleys_ stood,
    Within a copse of wattle-wood.

    The warriors were far away,
    Creeping on their unwary prey--
    Girdling them in a treach’rous ring,
    With artful deep manoœuv’ring.

    Some spearing fish upon the coast,
    Where Koonta’s mystic stream is lost;
    Some sneaking emu on the plain,
    Searching _Kupe_, or snaring game.

    Or, listless from a cool retreat,
    Were watching _Cowee’s_ great heart beat,
    Its ebb and flow, its wondrous tide,
    _Marma’s_ wayward, beauteous bride.

    The jocund laugh resounds along,
    Tho _lubras_ mark their little throng:
    The scornful look and air they bore,
    Engag’d in strife and mimic war.

    Behold them on the open plain,
    Naked as they from nature came
    In fierce opposing bands they range,
    Spears rattle, and dire words exchange.

    In childish accents, “Death,” they cry,
    And mockingly the foe defy;
    With quiv’ring limbs, and glaring eye,
    They rush to conquer or to die.

    Their mimic spears hiss through the air,
    And whirring _waddies_ cause despair;
    Their shields resound with awful blows--
    The ground is strewn with friends and foes.

    Now o’er the hills the _lubras_ come,
    In Indian file, by one and one;
    Each bears the produce of the day,
    Of roots, and herbs, and wallaby.

    With weary step they hasten down,
    And cast their burdens on the ground,
    And _cooey_ for their absent child,
    And waiting--gossip ere the while:

    “How at the last _corrobboree_,
    Ngamma’s familiarity
    With Yerku, shock’d all decency,
    Hence Bultawilta’s jealousy.

    “How saucy Tekartoo behav’d,
    While her husband in _palti_ play’d;
    And caused the stranger’s sly advance,
    And quarrelling, broke up the dance:

    “What dreadful things the _burkas_ said,
    For Tau had ate the sacred leg;
    How _Kuinyo_ would at night appear,
    With stomach vast, and snaky hair.

    “And Paune’s wonderful escape
    From cunning sorcerer’s deadly hate,
    As in the reeds he hiding lay,
    A bird by night, a bush by day.”

    Murmurs confus’d sound o’er the hill.
    Now near, then far, now loud, then shrill;
    Soon seen are many hunters bold,
    Like full of game and tales untold!

    To the camp they are drawing near,
    Very emulous to appear!
    Each more famous than the other,
    In the sight of wife and mother.

    Did ever see such kangaroo,
    As now borne past in grand review,
    Besides the fattest of emu?--
    Prais’d be the Manurapindoo!

    All stare, and gloat, and feast their eyes,
    As the game spread forth in glory lies;
    The _kuttas_ soon at work resound,
    And women, joking, dig the ground.

    Some a hole of just size prepare,
    And leaves and stones arrange with care
    Well heated these, and duly laid,
    Thus the native oven is made.

    The meal enjoy’d--their bodies greas’d
    They chat and laugh, or loll at ease;
    Hunting and warlike stories tell,
    Of sorcery, magic, charm, or spell.

    Of wondrous feats, and jerks, and jumps,
    Of water-holes, and scrub and stumps;
    Of narrow ’
scapes, and dreadful leaps,
    Of swamps, and storms, and flooded creeks.

    But there were none among the brave
    So skill’d, so witty, or so grave,
    Or could recite the tales of yore,
    Which he knew by many a score.

    Purley, the star--such was his name,
    Through all the tribes had spread his fame
    As hunter, warrior, _burka_ wise,
    In dance or song durst none despise.

    Now him around, in circles sat--
    The boys in front, the elders back;
    With gaping mouths and wond’ring eyes,
    They laugh and marvel with surprise!

    The tribe enwrapp’d in shades of night,
    While rows of fire are twinkling bright,
    Loud wails the plaintive monotone,
    To cure the pain, or soothe the gnome.

    “Now behold the road before me,
    How beautiful throughout Yerna,
    Watteyernorlo Tappandē,
    Miny-el-ity yarluke an-ambe.”

    “Now to the water-hole we’ve come,
    We two, together, at Tunte nung.”
    Thus corrobories they sing,
    How sweet the memories they bring.

    But others, of more mournful frame,
    Pierce the air in a tender strain,
    Sing of the lost beloved one--
    “O, why did you die! my son! my son!”

    Cow’ring nearer, a young man asks,
    “Tell us of the great First and Last?
    Who was, and who is yet to come,
    And why gaze we oft on setting sun?

    “Why the _burkas_ in silence meet,
    Why in uncertain whispers speak.
    In wild and lonely bushy creek,
    And there enchanted words repeat?

    For what the magic weapons use,
    Why ourselves in warm blood suffuse,
    Ord’ring women from th’ sacred place,
    Tell us the myst’ries of our race?”

    No! no! shouts the great _Uwinda_,
    Rather tell us the tale of Inda,
    And the famous hunter, Pilla,
    And their deeds upon the Willa.

    Crowding, then, around the _wurley_,
    They listen to the tale of Purley,
    Who in a measur’d tone begins,
    Of the famous Kangarooing.

THE TALE OF PURLEY.


    “In the long past, in days of yore,
    Such days, alas! return no more!
    Our tribe liv’d on the Wonga plain,
    That stretches southward to the main.

    “In all good things they richly shar’d,
    Sumptuously on dainties far’d;
    With bursting nets of game and fish,
    In implements surpassing rich.

    “We were, of all, the greatest tribe
    That in the North or West reside;
    Our dire enchantments never fail’d,
    Northern sorcerers ’
fore them quail’d.

    “Victors in ev’ry hunt and battle,
    ’Twas enough our spears to rattle;
    Our enemies would fly apace,
    Though rarely winners in the race.

    “But though so powerful and great,
    We dwindled at a rapid rate;
    For hunting when the tribe would go,
    There would be missing one or so.

    “Suggest, could none of us a cause,
    Whereby this sad mysterious loss
    Could be explain’d, or could be trac’d,
    For death had doom’d our noble race.

    “It was resolv’d, before too late,
    A gen’ral hunting match to make;
    The scrub, and swamps, and plains to scour,
    To find the foe, or magic power.

    “Everywhere searching, left and right,
    Till Nilarro appear’d in sight;
    When lo! a monster on them springs,
    Four men to ground he quickly brings.

    “The unnatural creature, then,
    _Instead of grass ate up the men!_
    They lift no spear, they lift no _wirri_,
    Powerless before Kupirri.

    “Behold! like burnt sticks in a row,
    By’s tail he fells them with a blow!
    Enrag’d, he lashes it about,
    And quickly puts them to the rout!

    “Homeward they rush, nor look behind,
    Frighten’d at e’en the rustling wind;
    Frighten’d at the grass-tree stump,
    Frighten’d at every stone and lump.

    “Abandon’d all, both shield and spear,
    Demented by their madd’ning fear,
    Nought else they know, nought else repeat,
    Than their sad loss--their dread retreat.

    “Long and loud the death-wail rose,
    They cut their arms--blood freely flows!
    While tears run down the sadden’d cheek,
    And on their breast they strike and beat.

    “‘My son! my brother! O my friend!’
    The women thus lament their end;
    While _burkas_ try all magic art,
    To cause the monster to depart.

    “Oh! then were long days of sadness,
    Unavailing wrath, and madness!
    But who, they ask, can kill Kupirri?
    Can bold man, can charm or _wirri_?

    “Then they arose in wild despair,
    Invoke the gnomes of earth and air
    Dread magic rites initiate,
    All spirits bad propitiate.

    “The _warra warra_ now declare
    Sure success to those who’d dare
    Their monster-enemy to face,
    The scourge of their devoted race.

    “Murmurs of doubt run through the throng--
    Who able was, or who was strong?
    With what weapons could they fight
    The monster on Nilarro’s height?

    “But none among the young or old,
    As hunters, were so brave or bold
    As the noted fighter “Inda,”
    And his far-famed brother “Pilla.”

    “‘We go,’ they in one voice exclaim,
    ‘Though we should ne’er return again,
    We’ll perish, or we’ll victors be
    O’er this cursed beast, Kupirri.’

    “Then with great skill, and with rare art,
    They well anoint and paint each part
    With mystic dots, with stripe and line,
    From head to foot in _karkoo_ shine.

    “Aloft a _witto_ nods and bends,
    And grace to every motion lends;
    A long white bone adorns the nose,
    While on the forehead--teeth in rows.

    “With a well-tried shield and spear,
    Wirri, and other war-like gear,
    _Kyahs_, _wommeras_, and _kuttas_,
    And the mystic _Paityowattas_.

    “Well versed in all ancient curses,
    Which, when one properly rehearses.
    Neither bird, beast, nor fish escape,
    But, unresisting, yield to fate.

    “Bright was the sun that shone that day,
    As the daring brothers bent their way;
    Sounds lamentable rise on high,
    Mingl’d with shouts that rend the sky.

    “Then solitary, on they go,
    Their progress mark--firm, stealthy, slow;
    Eyes, like their steps, most firmly bent,
    Both on the one great aim intent.

    “Through heat and scrub, all that long day,
    Till the last sun-beam died away;
    Then on a dreary, stony height,
    Repeat their charms, and camp the night.

    “Just where glimmers th’ early dawn,
    Loom’d grandly in the ruddy morn,
    Mount Nilarro, so vast and gaunt,
    The abyss of _Kupirri’s_ haunt.

    “Bald were its hoary sides, and steep
    Its gullies, precipitous and deep;
    A silent stream, from a hidden source,
    Pursued its dark meand’ring course.

    “Little they ate, they little said,
    But on their way they quickly sped;
    With eagle-glances scan the land,
    And closely watch on either hand.

    “Another night they try to rest
    In vain--with horrid fears opprest;
    For they in fancy often see
    The Red Kangaroo, _Kupirri_!

    “Half valiant, yet half affrighted,
    Arm’d with dark words recited,
    March on they, eager for the fray,
    Thirsting for their insatiate prey.

    “O’er hill and dale they longing seek,
    Through prickly scrub and winding creek;
    Anxiously from the heights, review
    The land of the Red Kangaroo.

    “Suddenly, in a gulley deep,
    Behold the creature fast asleep!
    Each at each in mute wonder stare,
    While sinking, almost, with despair.

    “_Kupirri_ moves his wondrous tail,
    Their courage ’gan direct to fail!
    His ears, immense, he wags about,
    And opes, awide, his awful snout!

    “He sleeps--shut are his dreadful eyes,
    Nor heeds his daring enemies,
    Who in right earnest now prepare,
    To slaughter him as he lies there.

    “Strike him with the blood of circumcision!
    Strike him with the tuft of eagle feathers!
    Strike him with the girdle--the _paltando_!
    Strike him with the _manga_, the _kundando_!

    “With mystic curse they imprecate!
    More soundly sleeps the monster great!
    Forth fly the deadly quiv’ring spears!
    _Kupirri_ only shakes his ears!

    “Trying then the long _uwinda_:
    Fearlessly the hunter, Inda,
    Steps up, and gives a deadly thrust,
    He sprawling, kicking, sends the dust!

    “Now Pilla, bold, with strong _wirri_,
    Batters, manfully, _Kupirri_,
    Madden’d by pain he vainly tries
    From his enchanted sleep to rise.

    “Then they the blood-drench’d _warpoo_ try,
    Sneaking upon him, very sly;
    Though standing by his panting side,
    In vain they try to pierce his hide.

    “But now! oh most unfortunate!
    The magic of an adverse fate!
    The hunters ’gan to disagree,
    In the presence of Kupirri.

    “Alas! for these two valiant brothers,
    They fight, and almost kill each other,
    Until at last, their fury spent,
    They see their folly and relent.

    “’Twas well, for lo! the earth did quake
    With the monster’s efforts to awake;
    They bravely rush, renew the strife,
    _Kupirri_ yields, with groans, his life!

    “Terrible was his dying pain,
    Agonising his pond’rous frame;
    Terrible were his mortal throes,
    Horror-struck stood by his foes.

    “A blacken’d rent marks the dire place,
    Where died the last of Kupirri’s race;
    Rarely do men to it repair,
    Very rarely go hunting there.

    “They leap for joy, and jump, and shout,
    And in steps mystic dance about;
    Refreshed now from their late affray,
    Proceed at once to divide their prey.

    “But with incredible surprise
    They see--doubting their own eyes,
    Their dead companions he had ate
    When Kupirri they last had met.

    “But skilful they in magic art,
    They lay the bodies wide apart,
    Then conq’ring in spiritual strife,
    They slowly raise the dead to life.

    “Round their old foe themselves they seat,
    Ready his choicest parts to eat.
    And thus their just revenge appease,
    And with his fat their bodies grease.

    “Laden with prey they homeward bend,
    Each talking with his late dead friend,
    Chatting of surprise and greeting,
    That ’wait their unexpected meeting.

    “Soon the great Wonga plain appears,
    They strike their shields, and raise their spears;
    With hasty strides now onwards press,
    Nor heed the place or time of rest.

    “Ne’er was there such a day as that,
    When the late-dead by the living sat;
    Nor were such _paltis_ ever sung,
    As through the woods all that night rung.

    “Very often they told the tale
    How their courage began to fail,
    How with _kutta_, spear, and _wirri_,
    They at length did slay Kupirri.

    “Time roll’d on, the hunters brave
    Were fast descending to the grave,
    The youths would oft recite, in play,
    The heroic deeds of a former day.

    “Years pass by, the period came
    When to perpetuate their fame
    Our tribe great mystic rites perform’d,
    Pilla and Inda were transform’d.

    “Behold ‘Pilla,’ the _Native Cat_!
    Varied spots adorn his back,
    For thus his cruel brother mark’d him,
    When he in quarrel spear’d him,

    “Behold the _Oppossum_, ‘Inda,’
    His face streak’d by the _uwinda_,
    Great Pilla’s unnatural deed,
    When they in fight both disagreed.

    “Henceforth our tribe did dwell in peace,
    Nevermore hurt by monstrous beast;
    They multiplied and grew apace,
    And so arose our mighty race.”

    Finish’d the tale, Purley arose,
    The list’ners hasten to repose;
    The camp is sunk in quiet sleep,
    The moon-beams through the foliage peep.

    The cricket chirps beneath the grass,
    The wodlalla bends beneath the blast;
    The fragrant wattle scents the air,
    The yerké skips around his lair.

    Heaven’s bridegroom, in all his pride,
    Doth forth in silv’ry glory ride;
    The evil spirits try in vain,
    Their unholy hands with blood to stain.

    Loudly wails the voice “kokunya,”
    The native trembles in his gunya;
    The lonely mawpawk softly coos,
    As coyishly his mate he woos.

    Upon the beach, the gentle roll
    Speaks sweet words to the list’ning soul;
    The wind sighs in the patta tree,
    Like a mother’s softest lullaby.

    Beauteous nature beams around,
    Breathing many a pleasing sound!
    We linger o’er the enchanted scene,
    Sweet vision of a heavenly dream!

NOTES, &c.


“Artful, deep manœuvring.”--The natives have various methods to
capture their prey, all indicitive of true huntsmen’s craft. Sneaking
the emu, a wary bird, is an instance where, With a screen of boughs
before him, the native gradually creeps within spear-range, and soon
gains his prize.

“Ancient Curses.”--Such curses are used when hunting. The different
kinds of game have different curses.

“Abandoned all.”--When a native throws away his spears, it is a sign of
the greatest fear and distress.

“Boston Bay.”--The harbour of Port Lincoln. It is protected by Boston
Island.

“Bultawilta.”--A man’s name.

“Burka.”--An aged man, the last stage through which men pass, and with
whom the knowledge of all charms, ceremonies, &c., is deposited.

“Bodies greased.”--A luxury highly appreciated by the natives. Captain
Sturt and Sir T. Mitchell bear testimony, that to a naked savage, in a
hot climate, it is, and must be, a great luxury. It supples the skin,
and prevents it chapping. The fat of all game is used for this purpose.

“Boys in front.”--Descriptive of the order in which, on all public
occasions, the natives arrange themselves; the children are invariably
placed in front.

“Cape Catastrophe.”--The South point of Port Lincoln district. Here
Captain Flinders had the misfortune to lose a boat’s crew, hence its
ominous name.

“Cooey.”--A loud call.

“Cut their arms.”--To this may be added, singing the hair off the head
with live coals, putting a large mass of white clay on the head, and
smearing the body over with the same, as signs of mourning for the dead.

“Corrobbories.”--Simply a play, and the highest, both in scope and
character of all their amusements. It is generally performed at night,
but occasionally in the day. The words sung are frequently meaningless,
or handed down from so remote a period as to have lost all meaning. The
corrobbory in the text is literally translated. Any incident, comic or
grave, trivial or important, may form the words of a corrobbory. The
song rarely exceeds two lines.

“Cowee.”--Water--the sea.

“Gunya.”--Hut--the same as wurley.

“Heaven’s bridegroom.”--In the native mythology, the sun is a woman, and
the moon a man. The former beats the latter till he dies; but dying, he
revives, and this goes on for ever hence the phases of the moon.

“Kyahs.”--Implements of war.

“Kokunya.”--The curlew, said at times to be inhabited with the spirit of
death. If a native dreams of his visitation, he dies.

“Kuttas.”--Implements for digging.

“Kupe.”--A grub inhabiting gum-trees, grass-sticks, &c. Though the
softest of creatures, it penetrates the hardest of woods. Its natural
history is little known. When _once_ eaten by Europeans it is so
relished as never after to be despised. The difficulty lies in the
_first_ attempt.

“Kuinyo.”--A fabulous being--death.

“Kupirri.”--The proper name for the red kangaroo.

“Lubras.”--It is singular, that whilst the language is replete with
terms of relationship, there should be found no distinction in the terms
for husband and wife. The word _lubra_ is used indifferently for either.

“Paityowattas.”--Small instruments used in incantations.

Page 7. “Behold them on the open plain,” &c.--Illustrative of children’s
games, to which may be added the ball, and what is known to Europeans as
the scratch-cradle.

Page 15. “Cowering nearer,” &c.--The current belief of the tribe.

Page 17. “In all good things,” &c.--Describes what, in native
estimation, a man or a tribe’s welfare consists.

Page 20. “Then with great skill,” &c.--Descriptive of a warrior’s
dress.

Page 21. “Repeat their charms,” &c.--No native retires to rest without
some such precaution; their belief is, that evil spirits are busy, in
the darkness, to kill them. Fire is a sure guardian. The writer once met
a native, many miles from his camp, benighted; he carried a large
fire-stick for protection.

“Paune.”--The name given to the ninth child. Sorcerers can change
themselves into any shape or substance, instantaneously. Each tribe
regards the other as peculiar adepts in sorcery. This belief in
witchcraft exercises a most baneful influence on the native mind. It is
the source of nearly all their quarrels and violent deaths.

“Patta tree.”--A kind of gum tree.

“Manurapindoo.”--A mystic curse, used in hunting.

“North.”--The North is regarded by the natives as the great seat of
diabolical agency, witchcraft, &c.

“Ngamma.”--A man’s name.

“Nillaro.”--A mountain in the Port Lincoln district.

“O why did you die,” &c.--A literal translation of a lament for the
dead.

“Spearing fish.”--On the Onkaparinga, the Murray, the Lake, &c., fish
are speared. All the spears are jagged, and vary in length according to
the fish to be taken, from six feet to twelve or fourteen feet; the
latter are for the Murray cod.

“Strike him,” &c.--Literal translations of the curses used on such
occasions.

“Strike their shields.”--Mode of salutation in war, as well as in peace,
and before a battle very striking and picturesque.

“Spirits bad.”--The aborigines have no _good_ spirits.

“Sacred leg.”--Women and children are not allowed to eat the hind leg of
a kangaroo--it is sacred.

“Tau.”--A woman’s name.

“Tunte nung.”--Mid-day.

“Tears run down.”--The expression of sorrow, by the native man, is
intense; tears will stream down the face, whilst the most sorrowful
lamentations pierce the air, at the same time the women cut themselves,
and the men spear each other in the arm; this occurs particularly at
funeral solemnities.

“Wurleys.”--Native huts, made from the boughs of trees, and in winter
strongly constructed, of a dome shape, and capable of holding from six
to a dozen persons. Near whaling stations, the ribs of whales are
employed as the frame-work, and the divisions filled up with boughs and
sea-weed.

“Warpoo.”--A kind of dagger; it is always _dedicated_, by being drenched
in human blood.

“Warra warra.”--Sorcerers.

“Wodlalla.”--A reed.

“Wife, and mother.”--Natives highly esteem the opinion of their mother;
this regard is a pleasing trait in their character.

“Winda, or uwinda.”--The largest spear, and generally jagged, from ten
to fourteen feet long.

“Yerke.”--A kangaroo rat.

“Yerku.”--A woman’s name.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
